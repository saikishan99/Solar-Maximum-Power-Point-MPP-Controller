# Heat Exchanger Temperature Control Using Advanced PID Controllers

## Overview
This project focuses on the application and enhancement of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers for regulating the outlet fluid temperature in heat exchangers. Heat exchangers play a critical role in industrial processes, requiring precise temperature control to ensure efficiency, stability, and energy conservation.

Conventional PID controllers, while widely used due to their simplicity and effectiveness, face challenges in handling process nonlinearity, disturbances, and equipment limitations. To overcome these challenges, this project implements an advanced internal model-based PID controller.
