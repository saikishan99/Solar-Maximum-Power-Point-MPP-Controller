# Solar Maximum Power Point (MPP) Controller

This project implements a Solar Maximum Power Point (MPP) Controller for optimizing the performance of solar energy systems. The main focus is on determining and simulating the ratings of a DC-DC converter to achieve maximum power output under varying conditions.

## Project Overview
The Solar MPP Controller ensures that the solar panel operates at its maximum power point by dynamically adjusting the operating conditions. This is achieved through the use of a DC-DC converter whose ratings are calculated and analyzed.

## How to Run
To execute the code and calculate the DC-DC converter ratings:

1. **Pre-requisites:**
   - MATLAB installed on your system.
   - Ensure that all required MATLAB toolboxes are installed.

2. **Steps to Execute:**
   - Open MATLAB.
   - Navigate to the folder containing the project files.
   - Run the file `DC_DC_con_Ratings_Calculations_Code.mat` by typing the following command in the MATLAB Command Window:
     ```matlab
     run('DC_DC_con_Ratings_Calculations_Code.mat')
     ```

3. **Output:**
   - The file calculates and outputs the required ratings for the DC-DC converter.
   - Results will be displayed in the MATLAB workspace and/or plotted as graphs.

## Files in the Repository
- **DC_DC_con_Ratings_Calculations_Code.mat:** Main MATLAB file to calculate DC-DC converter ratings.
- **README.md:** Documentation and usage instructions for the project.

## Notes
- Ensure all dependencies are resolved before running the MATLAB file.
- This project is intended for educational and research purposes only.
